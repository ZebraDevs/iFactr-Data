# iFactr Data


iFactr is a C#.NET-based, cross-platform mobile application development framework. iFactr.Data complements the iFactr Cross-Platform application stack by enabling easy cache queues for consuming data from RESTful endpoints. This Data-Stack can be used with or without utilizing the rest of the Cross-Platform application MVC model. It does depend on MonoCross Utilities for cross-platform network and file access. 


# Features
  - Caches data retrieved from RESTful endpoints.
  - Queues data for sending to RESTful endpoints.
  - Merges the Cache/Queue when offline for seemless data interaction.
  

iFactr is open source with a [public repository][Zebra] on Zebra Technology's GitHub.
